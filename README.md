==========


This repository contains a Midi app project that, given a **.mid** file, plays it and shows on stdout the notes being played on which channel.

Execute `gradle run` to start the app.

There are 9 midi samples provided in the [resources](https://github.com/RecuencoJones/LegadosTP6/tree/master/src/main/resources) folder.
Samples were taken with the export Midi function of guitar pro5.2
